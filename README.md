# League of Legends Summoner Timer
**A very basic website to time enemy Summoner spells. Test it here: [Click me](https://xtobishotz.github.io/LeagueofLegends-Summoner-Timer/)**

**This has been made without any interaction with the League API which means:**
  - Summoner spells have to be selected manually.
  - Champion levels aren't a variable which makes timing Teleport kinda useless since its cooldown scales down with level.
And I don't think it ever will because I'm not sure what Riots stance on timing Sums like this is.
- Unsealed Spellbook won't be Supportet.
